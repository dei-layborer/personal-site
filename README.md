# Personal Site

My personal site, hosted on [NeoCities](https://deilayborer.neocities.org/).  

Nothing fancy in terms of code, and I tried to keep it as minimalist as possible.  Most measurements are relative to screen dimensions, so it *should* respond fine to different window sizes.  I haven't fully tested it on mobile, though, and may need to do a separate stylesheet for that context.

Tested on Firefox and Chrome, and both worked.

## To-do list
- [ ] Add dark theme & switcher
- [ ] Add actual sub-pages for non-JS browsers
- [ ] Mobile-specific CSS
