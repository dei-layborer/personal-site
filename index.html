            <p>I’m an amateur developer (emphasis on “amateur”), mainly interested in user experience. I really enjoy the visual aspects of application development and try to make whatever I write as pleasant to look at as it is to use.</p>

            <p>I’m mainly interested in writing/creating things that help make certain tasks easier, especially in the context of work, school, or the like. For example, I’m looking at helping a local legal aid organization automate some of their casework.</p>

            <p>I primarily use basic web front-end (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript) due to portability and small file size. I learn by doing, and do have ideas for a desktop app or two somewhere in the pipeline, so will end up finding a more “traditional” (i.e. offline) language before too long. I personally do not like the weird web-desktop hybrids such as Electron.</p>

            <p>Beyond coding, I’m interested in languages (both obscure and not, ancient and modern), writing systems (the more obscure the better), history, chemistry, and theology. Sometimes I write small tools or apps to play with those things and/or to teach about them too.</p>

            <p>I occasionally have projects that don’t quite work as blog posts or GitHub repositories, such as translations, artwork, and so on.</p>

            <p>I’ve dabbled with programming since childhood, but never really got super into it until much later.  My interest evolved organically, as these things so often do, thanks to a need to automate some things at a job I had.  This started with learning Excel macros and then expanding it with VBA, and then into web-based technologies since they are far more powerful and can be distributed easily.</p>
            <p>As I’ve come to see more examples of the way code can make life easier, especially in the context of other tasks (such as the more repetitive demands of the Spreadsheet Mines), this has been that much more compelling.  I often struggle, though, with figuring out just what I would like to improve or streamline.  Right now, I’m mainly trying to reach out to people and organizations I already have contact with to see if I can’t start filling some needs there.</p>
            <p>At the same time, I’m trying to be more willing to start a project without being 100% sure what it’s for.  This has the added bonus of forcing me to think more systematically and robustly in how I code, which is both better practice and allows for greater flexibility in whatever it is I ultimately create.</p>
            <p>Any projects I’m working on (or have completed) are hosted over on <a href="https://github.com/dei-layborer">GitHub</a> (with the caveat that I’m not as good about pushing things as I should be.)  With anything embedded in a web page (that isn’t for a specific user), I usually host a “live” copy under the <b>Works</b> section of this site as well.</p>
