        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Seville is one of the Spanish (and European) cities most laden with history. So it is that the Andalusian capital is especially rich in legends and traditions going back to remote times. For example, did the Phoenician Melqart—later called Hercules—found Seville? This work does not neglect the story of the martyrdom and glory of Saints Justa and Rufina, during Roman times, nor, in the Visigothic, the tradition surrounding the revolt of Hermenegild against Liuvigild. </p>

        <h2>Traditions and Legends from Antiquity</h2>

        <h3>How Hercules Founded Seville</h3>
        
        <p>Every commentator and historian agrees that Seville was founded by Hercules.</p>
        
        <p>But can we credit this assertion? Isn’t Hercules a god from Classical mythology? How should we believe in a mythological god?</p>
        
        <p>Some 1,000 years before Christ, or about 3,000 years ago, the first Phoenician sailors arrived in Spain. They came through the Mediterranean Sea, having followed the coastline of North Africa, where they learned the Egyptian religion (of the god Osiris and goddess Isis) and where the founded a colony, near present-day Tunisia, which they named <em>Kar-tago</em>, meaning “New City.”</p>
